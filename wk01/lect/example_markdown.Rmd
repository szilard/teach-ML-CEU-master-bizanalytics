## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(plyr)

data_localfile <- "./data/bike_rental_train.csv"
train <- read.csv(data_localfile)

train$season  <- factor(train$season, labels = c("Spring", "Summer", "Fall", "Winter"))
train$weather <- factor(train$weather, labels = c("Good", "Normal", "Bad", "Very Bad"))
train$hour    <- factor(hour(ymd_hms(train$datetime)))
train$times   <- as.POSIXct(strftime(ymd_hms(train$datetime), format="%H:%M:%S"), format="%H:%M:%S")
train$Weekday <- wday(ymd_hms(train$datetime), label=TRUE)

ggplot(train, aes(x=season, y=windspeed))+geom_boxplot()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(train, aes(x=season, y=temp))+geom_boxplot()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
