## Packages

Install necessary packages. We will install more as we progress in the course.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("readr",
                   "data.table",
                   "purrr",
                   "glmnet",
                   "randomForest",
                   "gbm",
                   "rpart",
                   "caret",
                   "ROCR",
                   "titanic"
                   ))
```

If we want to use packages, we have to import them.
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(purrr)
```

We will use [`h2o`](https://www.h2o.ai/) in the second part of the course.
Its installation requires Java. Once that is installed, run

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("h2o")
```

To test if the installation works, run these:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(h2o)
h2o.init(nthreads=-1)

dx_train <- h2o.importFile("https://s3.amazonaws.com/benchm-ml--main/train-0.1m.csv")
dx_test <- h2o.importFile("https://s3.amazonaws.com/benchm-ml--main/test.csv")
md <- h2o.randomForest(x = 1:8, y = 9, training_frame = dx_train, ntrees = 50)  
h2o.performance(md, dx_test)@metrics$AUC
```

## Elements of R

Very useful resources: RStudio [cheat sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/): 
`ggplot2`, `rmarkdown` and more. For `data.table`, see [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/img/blog/data+table+cheat+sheet.pdf).
Building on [DA1](https://github.com/daroczig/CEU-R-lab) we are going to use
`data.table` for data munging, `ggplot2` for visualization and `rmarkdown`
for preparing notes (homeworks).

### Loading data

From data packages, reading csvs - `readr::read_csv`, `data.table::fread`.

```{r, results="hide"}
# there are packages that contain data
library(titanic)
titanic_train
```

```{r}
# readr reads into a decorated dataframe, a "tibble"
# -- same data that is packaged to the `titanic` package, both from Kaggle
df <- read_csv("../../data/titanic/train.csv")
str(df)
```

```{r}
# fread: for large csvs very fast and reliable. Reads to data.table
dt <- fread("../../data/titanic/train.csv")
str(dt)
```


### Data manipulation

Filtering, selecting, adding new variables, grouping, aggregation, random sampling,
counting unique elements.

```{r}
dt <- data.table(titanic_train)
```

```{r}
# filter only male
dt[Sex == "male"]
```

```{r, select}
# select columns
dt[, .(Sex, Survived)]
```
```{r}
# add a new variable
dt[, SurvivedInfo := ifelse(Survived == 1, "survived", "did not survive")]
head(dt[, .(Survived, SurvivedInfo)])

# delete variable
dt[, SurvivedInfo := NULL]
```

```{r}
# aggregate by groups
dt[, .(num_passangers = .N,
       num_survivors = sum(Survived)),
   by = .(Sex)]
```

### Loops, maps

For loop, lapply, sapply, purrr maps

```{r}
for (number in 1:5) {
  print(number * 2)
}
```
```{r}
# using the purrr package
walk(1:5, ~{ print(.x * 2)})

# if you want to keep the result in a list
doubled <- map(1:5, ~ { .x * 2})
str(doubled)

# or as a vector: 
doubled_vec <- map_dbl(1:5, ~ { .x * 2})
str(doubled_vec)
```


### Visualization

We are going to use `ggplot2`.

### Exercise: preparing a calibration plot

```{r}
# make a simple model for survival using logistic regression
model <- glm(Survived ~ Sex + Fare, data = dt, family = binomial)
prediction <- predict.glm(model, newdata = dt, type = "response")
dt[, Survived_Score := prediction]
```

```{r}
# bin people according to their scores
dt[, Survived_Score_Category := cut(Survived_Score, seq(0, 1, 0.1))]

# calculate mean of score and truth in categories
calibration <- dt[, 
      .(mean_score = mean(Survived_Score),
        mean_truth = mean(Survived),
        num_people = .N),
       keyby = Survived_Score_Category]
```

```{r}
# add the lines step by step and see how the figure becomes nicer and nicer!
ggplot(data = calibration,
       aes(x = mean_score, y = mean_truth, size = num_people)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype = "dashed") +
  xlim(0, 1) +
  ylim(0, 1) +
  coord_fixed(ratio = 1) +
  labs(x = "Truth",
       y = "Predicted",
       size = "Number of people") +
  theme_bw()
```

### Reproducibility

For yourself, for others. What is necessary for anyone else to reproduce
my analysis?

* others do not have the same directory structure: use relative paths instead
of absolute
* others do not necessarily use the same R and package versions
  + provide `sessionInfo()`
  + use some tool (out of the scope of this course. Examples: [`packrat`](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) package, [MRAN](https://mran.revolutionanalytics.com/) time machine)
* if I use random numbers, I have to ensure others use the same random numbers
  * simplest case: use `set.seed`

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
